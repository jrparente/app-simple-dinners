# Simple Meals

A simple app to help get dinner ideas and generate shopping lists.

Although there are many of these apps already out there, I find thatthe dinner ideas are not "simple" enough. I wanted something that would generate ideas for dinners with 1 protein, 1 carb and 3 vegs. Also, it includes one more "complicated" meal option per menu.

The app also generates a Shopping List for each Menu generated, and saves the generated menus in local storage.

## Features

- [x] Store ingredients in arrays ✅

- [x] Select Random ingredients from a meal ✅

- [ ] Add and select entire meals alongside random ingredients 🚨 Need to prevent duplicate vegs

- [ ] Select varied proteins for the menu (prevent eating same protein type on all meals)

- [x] Generate a shopping list from all the required produce ✅

- [x] Render results in the DOM ✅

- [x] Create separate components for each reusable part of the code: ingredients data ✅, individual dinners ✅, shopping list ✅

- [x] Save Generated Menus to Local Storage (and load them on refresh) ✅

- [x] Sidebar with all Menus saved in local storage. On click it displays the selected menu and ingredients for that menu. ✅

- [x] Ability to clear local storage ✅

- [ ] Ability to delete selected Menus from the sidebar
