# Simple Meals

A simple app that helps me get dinner ideas and generate shopping lists.

## Features

- Store ingredients in arrays âœ…
- Select Random ingredients from a meal âœ…
- Add and select entire meals alongside random ingredients âœ…
- Generate a shopping list from all the required produce ðŸš¨ The last meal of the set is an object. Need to display the ingredients of the object in the shopping list, instead of the name of the object.
- Render results in the DOM ðŸš¨ Shopping list is only rendering on the second button click
- Create separate components for each reusable part of the code: ingredients data, individual dinners, shopping list

## Roadmap

### Short / Medium term:

- Ability for the user to add ingredients and big meals to the Ingredients data (ie: most used ingredients in a household)
- Add cooking method (ie: steemed whitefish, grilled tuna steak, boiled eggs)
- Add images to ingredients? And maybe prefered cooking methods for each ingredient?

### Long term:

- Light/dark mode toggle
- Ability to store information in a database
