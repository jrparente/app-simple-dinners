# Simple Meals

A simple app that helps me get dinner ideas and generate shopping lists.

## Features

- Store ingredients in arrays âœ…
- Select Random ingredients from a meal âœ…
- Add and select entire meals alongside random ingredients ðŸš¨ Need to prevent duplicate vegs
- Generate a shopping list from all the required produce âœ…
- Render results in the DOM âœ…
- Create separate components for each reusable part of the code: ingredients data âœ…, individual dinners âœ…, shopping list âœ…

## Roadmap

### Short / Medium term:

- Ability to choose number of dinners to generate
- Ability for the user to insert the number of persons in household, and multiply the shopping list by that number of persons (the shoppigng list is currently per portion)
- Ability for the user to add ingredients and big meals to the Ingredients data (ie: most used ingredients in a household)
- Add cooking method (ie: steemed whitefish, grilled tuna steak, boiled eggs) And maybe prefered cooking methods for each ingredient?
- Add images to ingredients?
- Button to save Menu to local storage ðŸš¨ It's there, but it only saves the current menu, and it overrites whatever is already there. Would be great to save more than one menu, and choose which one you want to pull up.

### Long term:

- Light/dark mode toggle
- Ability to store information in a database
