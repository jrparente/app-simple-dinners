# Simple Meals

A simple app that helps me get dinner ideas and generate shopping lists.

## Features

- Store ingredients in arrays ✅
- Select Random ingredients from a meal ✅
- Add and select entire meals alongside random ingredients
- Generate a shopping list from all the required produce
- Render results in the DOM

## Roadmap

### Short / Medium term:

- Ability for the user to add ingredients to the arrays (ie: most used ingredients in a household)
- Add cooking method ideas (ie: steemed whitefish)
- Add images to ingredients? And maybe prefered cooking methods for each ingredient?

### Future:

- Light/dark mode toggle
- Ability to store information in a database
